		<p>Dear Readers,<br><br>
"Happiness is not something you postpone for the future, it is something you design for the present." -Jim Rohn<br><br>
Welcome to the 123rd issue of Sampark. The highlight of this issue is the workshop organized at various location where people had a lot to learn with fun. The pictures shared with us shows some of the enjoyable moments of the teams & we had a lot of pictures from which we could select few obviously due to space constraints. Some of the happenings missed in the earlier rounds have been covered in this one. The good performance of team members is covered in the appreciations, thanks for all the hard work & dedication. We get to know more about  Rajitha Palle our colleague from KO Hyderabad, who is featured in the KYC section. Welcome to the new joinees & wish them all the Luck.
<br><br>
Enjoy Reading!

		<li>Hareesh CH - KO Scripting, Bangalore has been appreciated for Project Regalia, “It had been a wonderful experience working on this with you. While I myself was not sure that this script could be done in 2 days time since it was humongous, however you not only did it on time but also managed a minimum number of changes and those too mostly cosmetics. It had a been a superb effort from your side. Just wish to work on many more such projects with you in coming times. Siva, Special thanks to you as well for assigning me a good resource on this challenging work and then helping me by allowing him to work on this continuously. Real heartfelt thanks."

Regarding Project Pegasus (2 and 4 Wheelers track), Abhijit has taken over from Pratyush and has been supporting us extremely well. We really appreciate his support to make the changes on urgent basis as we had a client discussion the next day. As you can see from the trail mail, he delivered the script at 3am which helped us immensely. Also, Sivaguru has been kind enough to accommodate all our requests and deliver the projects on time, considering the amount of work pressure the scripting team has. Look forward to work on many more projects. Thanks 😊"
